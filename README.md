# Research Dataset Collection

This repository contains datasets from multiple published papers since November 2023. The data is provided to support reproducibility and enable further research building on our published work as well as complimenting the EU Open Science doctrine. 

## Dataset Contents

This collection includes:
- Excel (.xls/.xlsx) files containing raw and processed research data
- Intermediate plots and visualization outputs
- Supporting data for MATLAB/Python scripts found in our [public repositories](#link-to-repos)

## Associated Publications

These datasets correspond to the following open-access publications:
- [Giovannetti, G., Burov, D., Galante, A., & Frijia, F. (2024). Full-Wave Simulation of a Helmholtz Radiofrequency Coil for Magnetic Resonance Applications. Technologies, 12(9), 150. doi: 10.3390/technologies12090150](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/12/9/150)
- [Giovannetti, G., Burov, D., Alecci, M., Rollo, R., & Galante, A. (2024). Dual-Channel Transverse Fields Radiofrequency Coils for 1.5 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Sensors, 24(7), 2049. doi: 10.3390/s24072049](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/7/2049)
- TBD

## Data Organization

**Note: The data in this repository is unstructured and presented "as is"** from the research process. Files are not organized in a standardized hierarchy but instead retain their original format and naming conventions as they were used during the research.

The repository contains various Excel files and image outputs directly related to our published papers. While there isn't a strict organizational structure, filenames typically indicate which publication they are associated with.

## Usage

These datasets are designed to be used with our analysis scripts available in the following repositories:
- [MATLAB Repositories](https://github.com/DenisBurov/mutinductance.git
https://github.com/DenisBurov/extract_profiles_from_csv.git
https://github.com/DenisBurov/standing_wave_test.git)


For specific usage instructions, please refer to the README files in each of those repositories.

## Requirements

- For Excel files: Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or similar spreadsheet software
- For running analysis: Please see the requirements listed in our MATLAB/Python repositories
